This repository contains all components of the Inspector Programming service, including the applications and infrastructure-as-code.

# Setup

## Client

First run 'npm i' to install packages.

Ensure you have two .env files configured: one in top level directory (/) and another in /packages/database. Please ask a member of the team for their .env files.

You should now be able to run the client using 'npm run start' or 'npm run web'.

## Database

The database is a SQL Server db run inside a docker container.

Ensure you have the .env file in your /packages/database with the appropriate fields for SQL_CONNECTION_STRING and SQL_CONNECTION_STRING_ADMIN. 

Ensure you have deleted any current files inside /tmp as these are generated by the container spin up and might interfere with a fresh setup. Delete them and use 'rm -rf ./tmp/mssql-data/*' to ensure they are fully deleted. 

Then run 'docker-compose pull' and then 'docker-compose up' from the terminal at the top level directory to generate the container.

Once the container is running you will be ready to use database functionality using the credentials listed in the SQL_CONNECTION_STRING config. Using this string you can ascertain the host, port, username and login creds as well as the database name. Some of these fields are TBC.
